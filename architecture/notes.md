To run multiple clusters on one machine with different namespaces using Kubernetes (K8S), you can use the kubeadm tool to create multiple clusters on the same machine. You can then use namespaces to isolate the different clusters from each other and prevent resources from one cluster from interfering with resources from another cluster.

Here is an example of how to create multiple clusters on one machine with different namespaces using kubeadm:

1. Install kubeadm on your machine by following the instructions in the Kubernetes documentation.
2. Initialize the first cluster by running the kubeadm init command, and follow the instructions to complete the initialization process.
3. Create a namespace for the first cluster by running the following command:
   kubectl create namespace my-first-cluster

4. Use the kubectl command to create a ConfigMap and a ServiceAccount in the namespace you created in step 3. This will allow you to use the kubeadm tool to create additional clusters in the same namespace.

5. Use the kubeadm tool to create additional clusters in the same namespace. To do this, run the kubeadm init command, and specify the namespace you created in step 3 using the --kubernetes-version flag.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 to create additional namespaces and clusters as needed.

In this example, we create multiple clusters on one machine using kubeadm, and use namespaces to isolate the different clusters from each other. This allows us to run multiple clusters on the same machine, with each cluster running in its own namespace.

It's important to note that running multiple clusters on one machine can be resource-intensive, and may not be suitable for all environments. You should carefully consider the resource requirements of each cluster and the capabilities of your machine before attempting to run multiple clusters on one machine.
